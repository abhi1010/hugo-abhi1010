Two blogs i really like and follow many a times are:





[SqlAuthority.com](SqlAuthority.com) - Excellent blog for Sql Server 2005. The guy has a very in-depth knowledge of Sql Server and I appreciate the way



[Scott's Blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu) - Another great blog where Scott Guthrie talks quite a bit about ASP.NET and tells the latest details coming in from Microsoft.



Just today I found another interesting blog. This guy talks about the interesting aspects in programming.
