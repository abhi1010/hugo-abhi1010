Writing code using VIM can be a bit overwhelming but it helps creating a few shortcuts there to make your life easier. Here I will discuss a few.

- First of all, it is always a good idea to set up your tabs and spaces
- Set up shortcuts for:
 - `Toggling of Auto-Indent` while pasting source text; very useful in code (_F2_ in my provided script)
 - `Toggling of Auto-Scroll` of Split windows (_F3_ in my provided script)
 - `Macro for Folding functions` within the source code (*_@q_* in my provided script)
 - `Smart case search` - based on whether the input is in caps or not
 - `Toggling of Mouse Usage` in VIM window - to allow quick selection of text (_F12_ in my provided script)


Please see the provided script below to have a look.
